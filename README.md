# Epic & Feature Monte Carlo

What is this report? 
This will detail, based on your historical Throughput (completed backlog items/user stories), the likely completion date of your Features based on the number of child items and a forecasted target date, as well as accounting for Feature work in progress.

Why would you use it? 
Forward planning for a given period (month/quarter/semester) and projecting the likely completion of work. Managing expectations around delivery and better understanding of the impact the amount of things you are working on at any given time (WIP) has on your Feature delivery.

When would you use it?
Use this when trying to understand what Features you are likely to deliver and when they will be delivered, ideally it should be viewed weekly.
